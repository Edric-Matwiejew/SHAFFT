@defgroup cpp_api C++
@brief C++ interface for SHAFFT.

The C++ interface provides both a Plan class with member functions and
procedural free functions. The portable complex types shafft::complexf 
and shafft::complexd work with both FFTW and hipFFT backends.

@see shafft::Plan for the class-based interface.
@see shafft.hpp for the complete C++ API.

@defgroup c_api C
@brief C interface for SHAFFT.

The C interface provides procedural functions for plan creation, execution,
and resource management. Suitable for integration with C code or when
object-oriented features are not needed.

@see shafft.h for the complete C API.

@defgroup fortran_api Fortran
@brief Fortran 2003 interface for SHAFFT.

The Fortran interface wraps the C API with Fortran-native types and calling
conventions using ISO_C_BINDING.

@see shafft.f03 for the complete Fortran API.
